        <!-- Speaker notes: I chose to present my paper arguments around the film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty 
          because it follows a person who imagines himself in unrealistic situations and has trouble distinguishing 
          them from reality. 

          I think this is an excellent way to interrogate the question of when a film can be realistic. I'll present 
          arguments from "Hazlett and Mag Uidhir - Unrealistic Fictions", and tie this into our class discussions on 
          the aesthetic value of a film.

H&M argue that a film's "good-making" features are those
that contribute to the aesthetic value of the film. This 
is similar to Carrol's idea of the evaluative basis of a 
film. We may only be able to compare films within the 
same genre, but we do so by comparing their relative 
aesthetic qualities.

            <!-- So, when is it important for a film to be realistic? This is my central claim:
              A film that prescribes advice to its audience must make its arguments "in good faith".

              Walter Mitty prescribes us to believe that the life we dream of is achievable if we'd 
              only step out of our imaginations and take the first step. In order to do this, the 
              entire film needn't be realistic, but the claims it relies on must be, namely:

              1. A bias to inaction must hinder Walter's life in the first act.
              2. Walter's newly-discovered to action realistically makes his life better.

              TODO: introduce the concept of the Prescriptive Export: 
                H&M's export is an piece of knowledge about the real world we are prescribed to believe. H&M focus on imports as 
                factual pieces of knowledge which may be true or untrue, rather than as prescriptions for how we should engage with
                the world or each other.

                I'd like to introduce the idea of a "prescriptive export" as a claim the film makes, directly or indirectly, about
                how we should engage with the real world. While H&M's exports are typically descriptive, a prescriptive
                export focuses more on values than facts. 
                This is I think what people would call the "message" of the film, be it political, philosophical, or ethical. 
                It's a way of interpreting the theme of the film as a call to action, and using art as a chance to win over 
                the hearts and minds of viewers. It's what makes film such a powerful medium for change.

              their reality, with convincing the viewer that the message of the film applies to their own reality.
