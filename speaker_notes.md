I got GPT to extract the speaker notes from the HTML comments of my presentation:

> Certainly! I'll extract the HTML comments verbatim from your presentation and organize them into speaker notes for each relevant slide. Here they are:

### Slide 1: Introduction

- **Speaker Notes:** "I chose to present my paper arguments around the film 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' because it follows a person who imagines himself in unrealistic situations and has trouble distinguishing them from reality. I think this is an excellent way to interrogate the question of when a film can be realistic. I'll present arguments from 'Hazlett and Mag Uidhir - Unrealistic Fictions', and tie this into our class discussions on the aesthetic value of a film."

### Slide 2: "To see the world, things dangerous to come, to see behind walls, draw closer, to find each other, and to feel. That is the purpose of life."

- **No specific speaker notes for this slide.**

### Slide 3: "When can we say a film is unrealistic?"

- **Speaker Notes:** "It's important to distinguish this from a film being 'inaccurate': 1. Amadeus is fairly realistic, in the sense that people behave more or less as you'd expect them to. 2. Amadeus is fairly inaccurate, because it makes false claims about historical figures like Salieri."

### Slide 4: "Flatfooted argument"

- **Speaker Notes:** "Image from Secret Life of Walter Mitty showing him imagining doing a cool thing but not actually doing it."

### Slide 5: "When/how does a film tell us it wants us to believe something?"

- **No specific speaker notes for this slide.**

### Slide 6: Mermaid diagram explaining imported ideas (beliefs about the world we should import into our understanding of the fiction)

- **No specific speaker notes for this slide.**

### Slide 7: Mermaid diagram explaining exported ideas (beliefs about the fiction we should export into our understanding of the real world)

- **No specific speaker notes for this slide.**

### Slide 8: "Flatfootedly, Walter Mitty falsely imports the ideas that Walter is capable of being a hero, but correctly exports those same ideas. What's going on here?"

- **Speaker Notes:** "Walter changes! Our perceptions of him change. Also, our perceptions of the film change. The film actually does want us to believe that Walter is doing all of these things. Then, when we see Walter snap out of his reverie, the film actually does want us to revise those beliefs. Then, when we see Walter become the person he had fantasized about being, it wants us to revise our beliefs once again."

### Slide 9: "Things Dangerous to Come"

- **Speaker Notes:** "TODO: connect this quote to the theme of the presentation, when a thing can be unrealistic, and how/whether this contributes to the quality of the film."

### Slide 10: Discussion on AI and Imagination

- **No specific speaker notes for this slide.**

### Slide 11: "Good-making and evaluative bases"

- **No specific speaker notes for this slide.**

### Slide 12: "To find each other, and to feel."

- **Speaker Notes:** "So, when is it important for a film to be realistic? This is my central claim: A film that prescribes advice to its audience must make its arguments 'in good faith'."

Walter Mitty prescribes us to believe that the life we dream of is achievable if we'd
only step out of our imaginations and take the first step. In order to do this, the
entire film needn't be realistic, but the claims it relies on must be, namely:

1. A bias to inaction must hinder Walter's life in the first act.
2. Walter's newly-discovered to action realistically makes his life better.

TODO: introduce the concept of the Prescriptive Export:
H&M's export is usually a piece of knowledge about the real world we are meant to believe.
H&M focus on exports as factual pieces of knowledge which may be true or untrue, rather than as prescriptions for how we should engage with the world or each other.

I'll call this a "descriptive export", because they are meant to describe our world.

I'd like to introduce the idea of a "prescriptive export" as a claim the film makes, directly or indirectly, about
how we should engage with the real world. While H&M's exports are typically descriptive, a prescriptive
export focuses more on values than facts.
This is I think what people would call the "message" of the film, be it political, philosophical, or ethical.
It's a way of interpreting the theme of the film as a call to action, and using art as a chance to win over
the hearts and minds of viewers. It's what makes film such a powerful medium for change.

### Slide 13: "That is the purpose of life."

- **Speaker Notes:** "Escaping reality is the purpose of film, but engaging with reality is the purpose of philosophy. So, when films attempt a Prescriptive Export, they must dialectically balance convincing the viewer that they have escaped from their reality, with convincing the viewer that the message of the film applies to their own reality."

### Slide 14: Conclusion

- **Speaker Notes:** "TODO: conclusion. There is a distinction between the facts a film wants you to believe and the values it wants you to believe. The latter is one of the most endearing aspects of a film, and allows you to build a universal basis for film across genre."

### Slide 15: Works Cited

- **Speaker Notes:** "Works Cited - Hazlett, Allan, and John J. Mag Uidhir. 'Unrealistic Fictions.' - Carroll, NoÃ«l. 'The Philosophy of Motion Pictures.' Blackwell Publishing, 2008."
