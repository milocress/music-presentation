Between 1845-52 Ireland suffered a period of starvation, 
disease and emigration that became known as the Great 
Famine.

The main cause was a disease which affected the potato 
crop, upon which a third of Ireland's population was 
dependent for food.

There had been crop failures before but during the famine 
it failed across the whole country, and reoccurred over 
several years. (Parliament UK)

6) they continue to relate, personally or vicariously, to 
that homeland in one way or another, and their 
ethnocommunal consciousness and solidarity are importantly 
defined by the existence of such a relationship.
